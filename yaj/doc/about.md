This is a peer-reviewed, open access and free journal that is part of
a community effort to increase the number of open public biological
and biomedical resources and help make them findable, accessible,
interoperable and re-usable or
[FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).  In
this journal you can publish a short paper with metadata describing
your data and/or software with little effort and <b>free of
charge</b>.

## What to submit?

A stable download URL, a description of the data, and some metadata,
suffice to create a <b>citeable</b> publication. Next to the data, a
reproducible workflow can be published to analyse the data. Data and
analysis can be published independently from research papers in other
journals increasing the chance you get cited for your work.

## What type of work do we accept?

1. Any type of free and open access bio/medical data
2. Any type of bio/medical workflow, ideally submitted as a runnable 'document'
3. Any type of free and open source bio/medical software

or combination thereof, provided the work directly relates to
biology/biomedical research and you are, or represent, the owner(s)
and/or creator(s).

Every publication goes through a
[public peer review process](review.html) which involves a quick check
on content, access license and metadata. This journal aims to be
<b>non-opiniated</b>. That means that all data resources, software
dowloads and workflow description (documents) are accepted provided it
is related to biological and/or biomedical research. All data has to
be published under an
[public domain open access license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)
and all software has to be published under a
[free and open source software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license). In
other words everything published here has <b>NO costs, NO paywalls, NO
restrictive terms and conditions</b>. Publication in journal is
<b>free of charge</b>.

## Author guidelines

1. Provide a unique and stable download URL for your data. Multiple
files require multiple URLs.
2. Write a description of your data. Use plain text or
[markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). An examples can be
found [here]
3. Create some metadata. Copying an existing JSON-LD file and enter
your data. Examples can be found [here]
4. [Submit](submit.html) the two files.
5. After that the publication will go online without delay and the
   review process starts.
6. On acceptance you are on track for world fame

## Community effort and research


Note that this journal is a work in progress (WIP) and ongoing
research project. We are in the process of adding datasets and
publications, essentially by adding descriptions and metadata as files
to [this repository]. You are invited to submit your own.

An example
of a publication can be found [here] with its JSON-LD [metadata]. The
source code that makes this journal is fully free and open source
software written by working bioinformaticians. The journal is hosted
through small donations out of research budgets. Both software and
data are online available and anyone can copy and host the journal
anywhere - this is just a piece of infrastructure. You can do with it
what you want and take the source code and and database and improve on
it, provided you abide by the relevant software and data licenses.

We
encourage contributions and research experiments, especially where it
comes to
[FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)
principles, automated submission systems (do we always need peer
review?), graph databases, reproducible analysis, and/or improving
people's academic track records. This is the time to break free! Use
your <b>imagination</b>.

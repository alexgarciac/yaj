This journal has the goal of increasing the number of public
biomedical data resources and making them findable, accessible,
interoperable and re-usable or
[FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) <b>free
of charge</b>.

A stable download URL, a description of the data, and some metadata,
suffice to create a <b>citeable</b> publication. Next to the data a
reproducible workflow can be published to analyse the data.

Every publication goes through a
[public peer review process](review.html) which involves a quick check
on content, access license and metadata. This journal aims to be
<b>non-opiniated</b>. That means that all data resources, software dowloads
and workflow description (documents) are accepted provided it is
related to biological and/or biomedical research. All data has to be
published under an
[public domain open access license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)
and all software has to be published under a
[free and open source software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license). In
other words: <b>NO costs and NO paywalls</b>.

Note that this is a work in progress (WIP). We are in the process of
adding datasets, essentially by adding descriptions and metadata as
files to [this repository]. You are invited to submit your own. An
example of a publication can be found [here] with its JSON-LD
[metadata].

# Author guidelines

1. Provide a unique and stable download URL for your data. Multiple
files require multiple URLs.
2. Write a description of your data. Use plain text or [markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). An
examples can be found [here]
3. Create some metadata. Copying an existing JSON-LD file and enter
your data. Examples can be found [here]
4. Submit the two files. We will create forms for that in the near
future. Until that point fork the publication repository on github,
add the files and do a pull request
5. After that the data will go online and the review process starts.

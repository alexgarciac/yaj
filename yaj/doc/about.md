This is a peer-reviewed, open access and free journal that is part of
a community effort to increase the number of open public biomedical
resources and help make them findable, accessible, interoperable and
re-usable or
[FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).  In
this journal you can publish a short paper with metadata describing
your data and/or software with little effort and <b>free of
charge</b>.

A stable download URL, a description of the data, and some metadata,
suffice to create a <b>citeable</b> publication. Next to the data, a
reproducible workflow can be published to analyse the data. Data and
analysis can be published independently from research papers in other
journals increasing the chance you get cited for your work.

What type of work do we accept?

1. Any type of free and open access biomedical data
2. Any type of workflow, ideally submitted as a runnable 'document'
3. Any type of free and open source software

or combination thereof, provided the work relates to
biology/biomedical research and you are, or represent, the owner(s)
and/or creator(s).

Every publication goes through a
[public peer review process](review.html) which involves a quick check
on content, access license and metadata. This journal aims to be
<b>non-opiniated</b>. That means that all data resources, software
dowloads and workflow description (documents) are accepted provided it
is related to biological and/or biomedical research. All data has to
be published under an
[public domain open access license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)
and all software has to be published under a
[free and open source software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license). In
other words everything published here has <b>NO costs, NO paywalls, NO
restrictive terms and conditions</b>. Publication in journal is
<b>free of charge</b>.

# Author guidelines

1. Provide a unique and stable download URL for your data. Multiple
files require multiple URLs.
2. Write a description of your data. Use plain text or
[markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). An examples can be
found [here]
3. Create some metadata. Copying an existing JSON-LD file and enter
your data. Examples can be found [here]
4. [Submit](submit.html) the two files.
5. After that the publication will go online without delay and the
   review process starts.


# Community effort and research

Note that this journal is a work in progress (WIP). We are in the
process of adding datasets and publications, essentially by adding
descriptions and metadata as files to [this repository]. You are
invited to submit your own. An example of a publication can be found
[here] with its JSON-LD [metadata]. The source code that makes this
journal is fully free and open source software written by working
bioinformaticians. The journal is hosted through small grants out of
research budgets. Both software and data are online available and
anyone can copy and host the journal anywhere. You can do with it what
you want and take it and improve on it, provided you abide by the
relevant software and data licenses. We encourage contributions and
research experiments, especially where it comes to
[FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)
principles, graph databases, reproducible analysis, and/or improving
people's academic track records.

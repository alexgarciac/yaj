This is a peer-reviewed, open access and free journal that has the
goal of increasing the number of open public biomedical resources and
help make them findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable or
[FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).  In
this journal you can publish a short paper with metadata describing
your data and/or software with little effort and <b>free of
charge</b>.

A stable download URL, a description of the data, and some metadata,
suffice to create a <b>citeable</b> publication. Next to the data, a
reproducible workflow can be published to analyse the data. Data and
analysis can be published independently from research papers in other
journals increasing the chance you get cited for your work.

What type of work do we accept?

1. Any type of free and open access biomedical data
2. Any type of workflow, ideally submitted as a runnable 'document'
3. Any type of free and open source software

provided the work relates to biology/biomedical research and you are,
or represent, the owner(s) and/or creator(s).

Every publication goes through a
[public peer review process](review.html) which involves a quick check
on content, access license and metadata. This journal aims to be
<b>non-opiniated</b>. That means that all data resources, software
dowloads and workflow description (documents) are accepted provided it
is related to biological and/or biomedical research. All data has to
be published under an
[public domain open access license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)
and all software has to be published under a
[free and open source software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license). In
other words everything published here has <b>NO costs, NO paywalls, NO
restrictive terms and conditions</b>. Publication in journal is
<b>free of charge</b> (did we already say that?).

Note that this is a work in progress (WIP). We are in the process of
adding datasets, essentially by adding descriptions and metadata as
files to [this repository]. You are invited to submit your own. An
example of a publication can be found [here] with its JSON-LD
[metadata].

# Author guidelines

1. Provide a unique and stable download URL for your data. Multiple
files require multiple URLs.
2. Write a description of your data. Use plain text or
[markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). An examples can be
found [here]
3. Create some metadata. Copying an existing JSON-LD file and enter
your data. Examples can be found [here]
4. [Submit](submit.html) the two files.
5. After that the publication will go online without delay and the
   review process starts.

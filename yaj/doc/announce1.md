Announcing a new data and analysis journal
</p>

This journal started out of ideas voiced in [1] and is rooted in the
linked-data and free and open source software communities. Coding started at the
[Biohackathon 2017](http://2017.biohackathon.org/) in Japan and the
results can be viewed [here].

The goal is to provide a platform for making biodata and source code
citeable, so researchers can add it to their academic track record. In
other words, generate the most impact with the least amount of
effort. Also, we want to unlock data and software that is now
invisible on the internet and make it findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable. Likewise we aim for reproducible software
analysis and workflows. We will encourage workflow documents, such as
those from the [common workflow language](http://www.commonwl.org/draft-3/UserGuide.html),
[Python Jupyter notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html), and
[R shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/).

Credit is also due to [JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org/), a generic
journal of FOSS, and [Open Journals](https://github.com/openjournals)
for exploring light-weight publications.

## Publication

Every publication comes as a text file in a supported format (starting
with Markdown) accompanied by a metadata file in JSON format. These
publications with metadata are stored in a git repository.

Metadata is 'named' and stored in directories which act as initial
sections. Information gets cached in a database.
